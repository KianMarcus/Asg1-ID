        <h2>Music</h2>
        <br>
        <p>Bob Marley's music is the definitive sound of reggae, which he globalized by blending its distinctive One Drop rhythm and syncopated guitar 'skanks' with elements of rock, soul, and R&B. More than just infectious melodies, his songs served as a powerful vehicle for his Rastafari faith and deeply felt messages of social justice, unity, and spiritual liberation. Growing up in impoverished Trenchtown, his lyrics addressed systemic oppression, political violence, and the struggles of the marginalized (e.g., "Get Up, Stand Up," "No Woman, No Cry"), while simultaneously offering hopeful, universal calls for peace and love (e.g., "One Love," "Three Little Birds"). Marley’s music thus transcended entertainment to become a global anthem for resistance and hope, cementing his legacy as a cultural ambassador for Jamaica and a prophetic voice for the world's oppressed.

            <P>Bob Marley was born in 1945 in rural Jamaica, but his formative years were spent in the impoverished yet musically rich Trench Town ghetto of Kingston. As a youth, he immersed himself in music, founding The Wailers with Bunny Wailer and Peter Tosh in the 1960s, evolving their sound into Reggae</P>

        <p>Marley gained global fame in the 1970s with his band The Wailers, becoming the leading voice of Reggae and Rastafari. He used his music to deliver messages of peace and justice globally, notably after surviving an assassination attempt in Jamaica in 1976. He spent his final years as a worldwide cultural icon until his death from cancer in 1981 at age 36.</p>
